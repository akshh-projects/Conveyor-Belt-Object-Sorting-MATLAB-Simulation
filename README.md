# Conveyor-Belt-Object-Sorting-MATLAB-Simulation
Simulates objects arriving on a conveyor, an ultrasonic-like sensor detecting an object at the pick point , and a servo actuator that pushes the object into a diverter bin. The simulation animates the belt and diverter, logs events, and computes metrics: detection accuracy, actuator duty cycle, average latency detection to actuation
